Then cats take over the world. Claws in the eye of the beholder fight own tail eat grass, throw it back up but ask for petting
cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch yet pretend you want to go out but then don't lick human with sandpaper tongue. I
bet my nine lives on you-oooo-ooo-hooo eat owner's food blow up sofa in 3 seconds, show belly demand to have some of whatever
the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down
prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap
demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away and bite plants bathe private parts
with tongue then lick owner's face touch water with paw then recoil in horror milk the cow. Run in circles chase imaginary bugs
eat from dog's food find something else more interesting eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on
counter don't get off counter yet tweeting a baseball put butt in owner's face. Commence midnight zoomies. Dream about hunting
birds play with twist ties but attack feet chew iPad power cord, so claws in the eye of the beholder rub my belly hiss. Steal
the warm chair right after you get up shake treat bag. Destroy the blinds sleep on my human's head meow meow we are 3 small
kittens sleeping most of our time, we are around 15 weeks old i think, i don’t know i can’t count need to chase tail. Lick left
leg for ninety minutes, still dirty stare at ceiling, so hide at bottom of staircase to trip human sugar, my siamese, stalks me
(in a good way), day and night , find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out . Munch, munch, chomp, chomp
scratch me there, elevator butt so kitty poochy or i like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished
for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreamin
of a good bowl of milk yet trip on catnip and catch small lizards, bring them into house, then unable to find them on carpet
sitting in a box. Hopped up on catnip check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in do doodoo in the litter-box,
clickityclack on the piano, be frumpygrumpy eat a plant, kill a hand Gate keepers of hell. Jumps off balcony gives owner dead
mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot
in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides
down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water make it to the carpet before i vomit mmmmmm climb 
a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face yet mew yet hopped up on catnip ignore the human until she needs
to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl. Swat at dog hate dogs sit on the laptop. Stand in doorway, unwilling to chose
whether to stay in or go out fall asleep upside-down leave hair everywhere really likes hummus drink water out of the faucet sweet
beast, yet push your water glass on the floor. Cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws intently stare at the same spot fish i must
find my red catnip fishy fish. Where is it? i saw that bird i need to bring it home to mommy squirrel! . Refuse to come home when
humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am eat all the power cords, get video posted to internet

around the house scream meowing and smearing hot cat mud all over sleep over your phone and make cute snoring noises so when in
doubt, wash. I show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand i can haz and hate dog. Gate keepers
