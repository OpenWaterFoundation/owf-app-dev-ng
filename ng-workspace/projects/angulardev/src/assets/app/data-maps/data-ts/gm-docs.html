<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview</h3>
<p>This visualizaton is being developed by <a href="http://openwaterfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Open Water
		Foundation</a> for the <a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/Pages/CWCBHome.aspx" target="_blank">Colorado Water
		Conservation Board </a></p>
<p>The intent of this visualization is to dynamically reflect and represent 3 seperate variables across time. The
	visualization is configured to plot seperate sets of data as 'bubbles' on the chart. These bubbles move across a y
	axis and x axis, to show 2 variables, while also varying in size, representing a third variable. All while moving
	across time. </p>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Usage</h3>
<h4>Legend:</h4>
<p>The legend on the right side of the visualization doubles as a tool to select certain bubbles, grouped by color.
	Again, the grouping of the bubbles can be set through the configuration file. For example, when looking at Water-Use
	Rate and Water-Use across all water providers in Colorado, you might want to group the bubbles by Basin given that
	information specified in the data file, of course.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4>Bubble Selection:</h4>
<p>There is a dropdown/search menu on the right side of the visualization that allows the user to highlight specific
	bubbles. You can remove bubbles already selected or add multiple bubbles to be highlighted. It is also possible to
	highlight specific bubbles on the visualization by clicking on them once.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4>Toggle Annotations/Tracer:</h4>
<p>The visualization defaults to specifications provided in the configuration file, which can specify aspects such as
	showing annotation shapes or displaying tracers which track the bubbles movements. You can toggle these attributes
	using the buttons at the right side of the visualization.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4>Time Slider:</h4>
<p>The time slider at the bottom of the visualization is interactive. The user can choose to either click and drag to
	move the visualization across points of time(*), or the user can use the controls located below the year slider to
	play, pause, replay the visulaztion, or move the visualizion forward/backward a year. </p>
<p>The scale on the slider is intended to span the start and end date and fit date intervals between them based off of
	d3 defaults, as well as ensuring there is no overlap of the tick labels. The handle slider should move along the time
	slider based off the precision specified by the configuration file.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;">* If the user moves the slider across time too quickly it will reflect in the tracer's which
	track the data, and may result in spontaneous behavior through the display of the tracers.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4>Speed Slider:</h4>
<p>You can click and drag the slider to change the speed at which the visualization will play.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Display</h3>
<h4>Datatable/Interpolation:</h4>
<p>At the bottom of the visualization there is a datatable. When hovering over a bubble the data for this bubble at the
	current time shown on the time slider will be displayed in this datatable. The visualization itself interpolates
	across all points of time to fill in data points, in order to fluidly display the animation. However, the datatable
	should only display the raw data used as the input data for the visualization, given that the units of time on the
	time slider are the same as the intervals for the input data. For example if the user specifies years in the
	configuration file, the input data should be in years as well. The visualization may interpolate any data missing from
	these specific intervals of time if it missing in the input data. This functionality may be revised to be more
	accurate to true data later on.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4>Annotation Table: </h4>
<p>The annotation table is meant to display any annotations specified as general annotations in the annotation file
	provided in the configuration file. General annotations are co-ordinated with certain times and should generally apply
	to all data shown, for example a general annotation may be an important weather related incedent that may have
	affected most of the water providers across Colorado, and may consequently explain certain behavior seen through the
	visualization.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Data</h3>
<p>The input data that was used to run the visualization can be seen from clicking on the data tab.</p>
